# Contributing to Résumé Tailor Harness

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers local setup and the
checks your change must pass.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Node 22** and `npm`

## Setup

```bash
uv run --no-project scripts/bootstrap.py
make setup           # equivalent short alias
make setup-browser   # optional: Playwright Chromium, only for live scraping
```

## Running the app

```bash
uv run python scripts/dev.py  # works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
make dev                     # equivalent short alias
```

## Before you open a PR

Run the full local gate — it mirrors CI exactly:

```bash
make verify          # lint + tests + web build
```

Or individually:

```bash
make lint            # ruff (Python) + eslint (web)
make test            # pytest (API) + vitest (web)
make build           # web production build
```

The Python suite is **fully offline** — agents and the browser are faked, so it
needs no API key and no network. Please keep new tests offline; use fixtures, not
live endpoints.

## Ground rules

- **Fact-lock is sacred.** Every bullet a tailored resume produces must trace to a
  fact in the profile. Do not add code paths that let agents invent experience,
  and do not weaken the `fact-check` review gate.
- Match the surrounding code's style, naming, and structure.
- Keep commits focused; write a clear commit message.

## CI

PRs and pushes into `main` run the full CI gate: `python-quality`,
`web-quality` (including the production build), and a non-blocking security
audit (`pip-audit` + `npm audit`). Matching PRs into `main` also run the public
browser fixtures. Fix failures — don't skip tests or disable lint rules to get
green. CodeQL analysis is active through GitHub's default code scanning setup.
This public repository's standard hosted runners do not consume the account's
included Actions minutes.

## Branch protection

`main` requires passing CI and at least one review. Please branch from `dev`
and open a PR back into `dev` rather than targeting `main` directly.
