# Environment configuration

`resume-tailor-harness` loads process settings from environment variables and then from
the repository-root `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local use;
hosted deployments should set the same names in the platform environment.

This page is the complete reference for the environment-backed fields in
`resume_tailor_harness.config.Settings`. Blank values mean that the integration or
override is disabled. Boolean values accept the normal Pydantic settings forms,
including `true` and `false`. Restart the API and workers after changing a
setting because process settings are cached.

The Docker image always defaults `BROWSER_ENABLED=false`. Its other defaults are
mode-aware: a zero-config image starts in local mode with API docs enabled and
non-secure localhost cookies; hosted mode defaults `SECURE_COOKIES=true`,
`DISABLE_API_DOCS=true`, and `REGISTRATION_MODE=open`. Set `APP_MODE` to `local`
or `hosted`; `auto` (the image default) selects hosted mode when hosted-only
settings such as `APP_BASE_URL`, `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`, or `SESSION_SECRET` are
present.

## LLM providers and models

| Variable | Default | Accepted values and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | empty | Shared Anthropic credential. Bare model IDs route to Anthropic. |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Direct Anthropic API endpoint. Applied explicitly whenever routing selects `api`, so it cannot inherit the Sub2API endpoint. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | empty | Shared OpenAI credential for `openai:` model IDs, optional embeddings, and direct audio operations. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Direct OpenAI API endpoint. Applied explicitly whenever routing selects `api`; transcription and TTS always use this endpoint because Sub2API may not implement the audio APIs. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | empty | Shared Google Gemini credential for `gemini:` model IDs. |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | empty | Shared DeepSeek credential for `deepseek:` model IDs. |
| `SUB2API_BASE_URL` | empty | Subscription-gateway origin shared by all routed providers; empty disables gateway routing unless a provider is pinned to `subscription`. |
| `SUB2API_ANTHROPIC_KEY` | empty | Write-only Anthropic credential for the subscription gateway. |
| `SUB2API_OPENAI_KEY` | empty | Write-only OpenAI credential for the subscription gateway. |
| `SUB2API_GEMINI_KEY` | empty | Write-only Gemini credential for the subscription gateway. |
| `SUB2API_DEEPSEEK_KEY` | empty | Write-only DeepSeek credential for the subscription gateway. |
| `ANTHROPIC_ROUTE_MODE` | `auto` | `auto`, `subscription`, or `api`; selects gateway routing when configured, forces the gateway, or forces the direct Anthropic API. |
| `OPENAI_ROUTE_MODE` | `auto` | `auto`, `subscription`, or `api`; selects gateway routing when configured, forces the gateway, or forces the direct OpenAI API. |
| `GEMINI_ROUTE_MODE` | `auto` | `auto`, `subscription`, or `api`; selects gateway routing when configured, forces the gateway, or forces the direct Gemini API. |
| `DEEPSEEK_ROUTE_MODE` | `auto` | `auto`, `subscription`, or `api`; selects gateway routing when configured, forces the gateway, or forces the direct DeepSeek API. |
| `CHEAP_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Model used for inexpensive extraction and classification work. |
| `MID_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Model used for intermediate reasoning and review work. |
| `PREMIUM_MODEL` | `claude-opus-5` | Model used for the highest-quality writing and escalation paths. |
| `CHEAP_REASONING_EFFORT` | unset | Optional provider-specific reasoning setting for the cheap tier. |
| `MID_REASONING_EFFORT` | unset | Optional provider-specific reasoning setting for the mid tier. |
| `PREMIUM_REASONING_EFFORT` | unset | Optional provider-specific reasoning setting for the premium tier. |
| `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` | `gemini:gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | Model used by audio transcription. |
| `SPEECH_MODEL` | `openai:gpt-4o-mini-tts` | Text-to-speech model used by audio-preferred mock interviews. |
| `SPEECH_VOICE` | `marin` | Voice used for generated interviewer speech. |
| `PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables supported providers' static system-prompt cache. |
| `LLM_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Maximum LLM fan-out; integer at least 1. |
| `LLM_RETRIES` | `2` | Structured/provider retry count; non-negative integer. |
| `LLM_RETRY_DELAY` | `1` | Base retry delay in seconds; non-negative integer. |
| `RUN_ANNOUNCE_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `3600` | How recently a background run must have finished to be announced on reconnect; integer seconds from 0 through 86400. |

Model IDs can use `openai:`, `gemini:`, or `deepseek:` prefixes. A bare model
ID uses Anthropic. Reasoning-effort strings are deliberately provider-specific;
leave them unset unless the selected provider/model documents support for the
chosen value.

For OpenAI and Anthropic, every routing decision selects the credential and
endpoint together. `subscription` uses `SUB2API_<PROVIDER>_KEY` with
`SUB2API_BASE_URL`; `api` uses the provider's normal `*_API_KEY` with its
`*_BASE_URL`; and `auto` chooses between those complete pairs based on whether
the provider has a Sub2API key. SDK process defaults are never allowed to mix
one route's key with the other route's endpoint.

## API, storage, and runtime

| Variable | Default | Accepted values and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_URL` | `sqlite:///data/resume_tailor_harness.db` | SQLAlchemy database URL. The supported Railway topology uses one SQLite replica and one persistent volume. |
| `APP_MODE` | `auto` in Docker | Container runtime mode: `local`, `hosted`, or `auto`. Outside the container, use the `serve --mode` option. |
| `API_TOKEN` | empty | Optional bearer token for scripts in hosted mode. Local mode ignores API/account authentication. |
| `BROWSER_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables browser-backed connectors. The Docker image sets this to `false`. |
| `STREAM_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables streamed conversational turns; `false` uses the blocking fallback. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173` | Comma-separated allowed browser origins. |
| `PULL_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Concurrent connector fetches; integer at least 1. |

| `DISABLE_API_DOCS` | `false` | Disables `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json`. The Docker image defaults this to `true` only in hosted mode. |
| `REGISTRATION_MODE` | `invite` | `closed`, `invite`, or `open`. The Docker image defaults this to `open` only in hosted mode. |
| `GLOBAL_DAILY_SIGNUP_LIMIT` | `50` | Platform-wide rolling daily verification-email limit; integer at least 1. |
| `GLOBAL_WEEKLY_TOKEN_BUDGET` | `50000000` | Legacy shared-key weekly token circuit breaker; non-negative integer, used while cost enforcement is in shadow mode. |

See [Deploying to Railway](deploy-railway.md) for the production values that
must differ from local defaults, and [Cost quotas](cost-quotas.md) for quota
units and rollout behavior.

## Skill taxonomy

| Variable | Default | Accepted values and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `DOMAINS_PER_CATEGORY_TARGET` | `12` | Soft domain-count target; integer from 3 through 50. The deprecated `DOMAINS_PER_CATEGORY_CAP` alias remains accepted for one compatibility release. |
| `SKILL_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `openai:text-embedding-3-small` | Embedding model used to shortlist taxonomy candidates; lexical retrieval is the fallback. |
| `SKILL_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` | `256` | Embedding request/cache batch size; integer from 1 through 256. |
| `TAXONOMY_MAINTENANCE_MAX_CHURN` | `0.2` | Maximum maintenance churn ratio; number from 0.01 through 1.0. |

| `TAXONOMY_PLACEMENT_FLOOR` | `true` | Places eligible unresolved skills into deterministic general categories; `false` restores historical unassigned behavior. |


## Career skills and H-1B enrichment

| Variable | Default | Accepted values and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CAREER_SKILL_ROOT` | `skills` | Root directory containing approved local career-skill packages. |
| `CAREER_SKILL_MANIFEST` | `skills-lock.json` | Hash-pinned career-skill manifest. |
| `H1B_MCP_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables optional historical H-1B enrichment. |
| `H1B_MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | `stdio` or `streamable-http`. |
| `H1B_MCP_COMMAND` | empty | Required only for enabled `stdio`; `H1B_MCP_URL` must then be empty. |
| `H1B_MCP_URL` | empty | Absolute credential-free HTTP(S) URL required only for enabled `streamable-http`; command must then be empty. |
| `H1B_MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` | MCP timeout in seconds; integer from 1 through 300. |
| `H1B_MCP_MAX_RESULT_CHARS` | `200000` | Maximum accepted tool-result characters; integer from 1000 through 1000000. |
| `H1B_CACHE_TTL_DAYS` | `30` | Company-cache lifetime; integer from 1 through 365 days. |
| `COMPANY_INTELLIGENCE_TTL_DAYS` | `30` | Source-backed company-dossier freshness window; integer from 1 through 365 days. Expiry marks saved evidence stale but never refreshes it automatically. |
| `H1B_ENRICH_MAX_COMPANIES_PER_RUN` | `50` | Maximum uncached companies researched per run; non-negative integer, with `0` meaning unlimited. |

Historical H-1B data is an advisory signal only. It never confirms current
sponsorship policy and never hard-rejects a job.

For the bundled Docker service, leave these values at their defaults in `.env`
and start the `h1b` profile with:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.h1b.yaml --profile h1b up --build
```

The override injects a private `http://h1b-job-search-mcp:8000/mcp` URL only
for that profile; a container must not use `localhost` to reach its companion
service.

## Gmail and platform mail

| `GMAIL_MAX_MESSAGES` | `50` | Maximum recent messages read per sync/draft lookup; integer at least 1. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | empty | Resend HTTPS mail credential. When present, Resend wins over SMTP. |
| `MAIL_FROM` | empty | Backend-neutral sender address; falls back to `SMTP_FROM`. |
| `SMTP_HOST` | empty | SMTP server; blank selects the null mailer unless Resend is configured. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port; integer from 1 through 65535. |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | empty | SMTP authentication username. Blank skips SMTP authentication. |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | empty | SMTP authentication password. |
| `SMTP_FROM` | empty | SMTP sender and fallback for `MAIL_FROM`. |
| `SMTP_STARTTLS` | `true` | Enables SMTP STARTTLS. |

The local CLI Gmail flow uses `config/gmail_credentials.json` instead of the
platform OAuth variables. Railway plans below Pro block outbound SMTP; use the
Resend backend there unless the deployment plan supports SMTP egress.
