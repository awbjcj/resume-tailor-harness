# 8. One egress gateway, tenant-confined storage, and configuration-only origin trust

## Context

A source-based threat model of the public multi-user deployment
(`resume-tailor-harness-threat-model.md`, `security_best_practices_report.md`) found
three trust-boundary gaps that a normal authenticated tenant — not just an
external attacker — could exploit:

1. **SSRF.** `profile/intake.py` already implemented DNS-pinned, redirect-
   revalidated, size/content-type-bounded public-URL fetching for profile
   source URLs, but job/source URL ingestion (`discovery/url_ingest/fetch.py`,
   `discovery/connectors/detect.py`) and `services/sources.py` used plain
   `httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)` with no destination policy. Two
   different fetch paths for the same class of user-influenced URL meant the
   hardened one was incidental, not architectural.
2. **Cross-tenant file reads via import.** Resume/cover-letter downloads
   passed a stored `pdf_path` straight to `FileResponse`. A tenant fully
   controls their own exported-then-reimported workspace database, so nothing
   stopped an imported row's `pdf_path` from pointing at an absolute path
   outside that tenant's `output/` directory — reachable because the API
   process runs as one UID across all tenant workspaces.
3. **Proxy-dependent security decisions.** Session-cookie `Secure`, and the
   Google/Gmail OAuth redirect URI, were derived from `request.url.scheme` and
   `X-Forwarded-Host`/`-Proto` — correct only if the edge proxy is guaranteed
   to strip/replace those headers, which Railway's default Uvicorn setup does
   not declare.
4. **Path-bearing render configuration.** `render/templates.py::template_path_for`
   accepted an arbitrary `template_path`/`output_dir` from `RenderConfig`, and
   `render/service.py`/`cover_letter/render.py` wrote new PDFs under that
   config value rather than the tenant's own output directory — the same
   escape as (2), reachable through render configuration instead of import.
5. **Unbounded archive extraction.** `services/backup.py::_extract_validated`
   validated member paths/types/duplicates but called `tar.getmembers()` /
   `extractall()` with no cap on member count, per-file size, total expanded
   bytes, or compression ratio, so an imported archive could exhaust disk,
   memory, or CPU shared by every tenant.

Fixing each call site ad hoc would leave the same class of bug reachable the
next time someone adds a URL fetch, a download route, an OAuth-adjacent
redirect, or an import path — exactly the "several trusted helpers exist, but
sensitive paths can bypass them" pattern the report calls out as the main
weakness.

## Decision

Introduce three narrow, mandatory seams and route every existing call site
through them:

- `security/outbound.py` (`fetch_public_text`, `fetch_public_bytes`,
  `resolve_public_url`, `validate_public_url`) is the only code allowed to make
  an HTTP(S) request to a user-supplied URL. `fetch_public_text` owns bounded
  text retrieval and its redirect loop; `fetch_public_bytes` owns one pinned,
  bounded browser-resource hop and returns redirects to its caller for another
  policy decision. `profile/intake.py` was rewritten to delegate to this seam
  instead of keeping a parallel copy of the same logic.
- `security/browser_gateway.py::BrowserGateway` is the policy broker for every
  request initiated by the public-page browser. It applies robots decisions,
  shared host leases, request/byte budgets, redirect revalidation, throttling,
  and the closed read-only method allowlist before delegating each hop to
  `fetch_public_bytes`. The Playwright child has no ambient egress: handled
  requests travel over bounded parent IPC, its fallback proxy denies traffic,
  and service workers and WebSockets are disabled. The child may navigate,
  inspect, click declared controls, and issue narrowly classified JSON job-search
  reads; it may not submit forms, execute generated code, or use arbitrary POSTs.
- `tenancy/storage.py::artifact_path` is the only way a download route may
  turn a stored artifact path into a filesystem path, and is fail-closed: in
  multi-user mode it raises `TenantPathError` for anything outside the active
  tenant's `output/` root. `account.py`'s workspace-import validator
  normalizes every imported `pdf_path` to a tenant-relative value (or rejects
  the import) *before* the atomic swap, so the confinement holds even for
  data the tenant fully controls. `render/service.py` and
  `cover_letter/render.py` write new artifacts under the tenant context's
  output directory rather than `RenderConfig.output_dir`, and
  `render/templates.py` refuses a legacy `template_path` in multi-user mode.
- `api/public_url.py::public_url` builds OAuth callback URIs from
  `Settings.app_base_url`, never forwarded headers. `Settings.secure_cookies`,
  `Settings.allowed_hosts` (→ `TrustedHostMiddleware`), and
  `Settings.disable_api_docs` make the remaining proxy-dependent decisions
  explicit configuration instead of implicit header trust.
- `services/backup.py::_extract_validated` streams archive members and rejects
  the import mid-scan once member count, per-file size, total expanded bytes,
  or compression ratio crosses a configured budget; `services/settings_bundle.py`
  delegates to the same function with its own tighter limits instead of a
  second, independently-maintained size check.

Fixing each finding independently (patching `fetch_static`'s client, adding a
one-off path check in each router) was rejected: it reproduces the same
"trusted helper, bypassable path" shape the audit flagged, and gives the next
new URL-fetching or download-serving call site nothing to fail closed against.

## Consequences

- Any new code that fetches a user-supplied URL must call through
  `security/outbound.py`; a bare `httpx.get`/`follow_redirects=True` on such a
  URL is a regression, not a style preference.
- Browser-driven fetches additionally must pass through `BrowserGateway`; a
  Playwright context with direct network access or an unclassified mutation is
  a trust-boundary regression. New allowed browser methods require an explicit,
  test-backed policy change here rather than a call-site exception.
- Any new download or render-output route must resolve its path through
  `tenancy/storage.py::artifact_path` (or an equivalent tenant-confined
  helper) rather than trusting a stored string directly.
- Local single-user mode (no tenancy context) is intentionally exempt from the
  confinement — `artifact_path` returns the path unchanged when
  `current_context()` is `None` — preserving existing CLI behavior with
  explicit `--config`/`--out` paths.
- This closes the P0 items reachable from normal (non-privileged) tenant
  action. It does **not** close the remaining P0/P1 items the threat model
  records as separate work: platform-wide shared-key budgets, OAuth state
  browser-binding, archive-expansion resource limits, and worker-process
  isolation for Typst/document parsing still need their own seams.
