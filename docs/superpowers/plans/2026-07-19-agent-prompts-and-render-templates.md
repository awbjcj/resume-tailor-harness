# Agent Prompt Registry + Web-Friendly Rendering Templates — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Every LLM agent's prompt is viewable in the web app with a per-agent user-guidance layer (fact-lock preserved), and the Rendering settings become a template picker + validated custom-template upload with no filesystem paths in the contract.

**Architecture:** A declarative `PromptSpec` registry projects instruction lists that stay defined in their home modules; a per-workspace `config/agent_guidance.yaml` is layered beneath immutable rules by a `with_guidance` helper wired into every agent builder. Rendering swaps `template_path`/`output_dir` for a template id + `fit_one_page` flag: bundled templates come from a manifest, custom `.typ` uploads are validation-compiled with Typst's `root` pinned to their own directory, and legacy `render.yaml` keys keep loading for CLI users.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI + Pydantic (`CamelModel` camelCase wire), agno agents, typst (Python wheel, offline), React + TanStack Query + shadcn (web), pytest + vitest.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-agent-prompts-and-render-templates-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Tests are offline: no API key, no network. `typst.compile` is a local wheel and IS allowed in tests.
- Wire format is camelCase via `CamelModel` (`api/schemas/base.py`); Python stays snake_case.
- Every error uses the `{ "error": { code, message, details? } }` envelope via `ApiException` (`api/errors.py`).
- Error codes (exact strings): `unknown_agent` (404), `agent_not_editable` (409), `template_not_found` (422), `template_invalid` (422).
- Guidance cap: **4000 characters** per agent. Custom template cap: **200 KB**, extension `.typ` only.
- Only `reviewer-fact-check` is non-editable.
- After any schema/router change, regenerate contracts: `bash scripts/gen_ts_client.sh` (writes `contracts/openapi.json`, `contracts/ts/api.ts`, copies to `web/src/lib/api/schema.ts`). The drift gate is `tests/api/test_openapi_contract.py`.
- Workspace-relative paths always go through `resolve_tenant_path` (`tenancy/paths.py`); constants for new artifacts live in `tenancy/paths.py`.
- Backend test command: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest <file> -q`. Lint: `ruff check`. Web tests: `cd web && npx vitest run <file>`.
- Import-cycle rule: `prompts/guidance.py` must NOT import `prompts/registry.py` (registry imports every agent module; those modules import guidance). Editability lives in `guidance.NON_EDITABLE_KEYS`; registry derives `editable` from it.

## Correctness Amendments (binding)

These amendments supersede conflicting snippets later in the plan.

1. **Registry completeness includes dynamic and system-prompt-free agents.** Register the
   merged advisory runner as `reviewer-merged-advisory`, projecting an invariant
   module-level base instruction list; its configured reviewer rubrics remain visible in
   the individual reviewer entries. Move the Gmail fallback classifier's classification
   contract into module-level instructions, register it as `email-classifier`, and layer
   guidance into its builder. Completeness tests must enumerate every production
   `Agent(...)` site or document a generic infrastructure-only exemption.
   Registry entries must project the full invariant instruction composition used by
   builders (including common/craft layers), not only the raw role-specific constant;
   dynamic session/config additions are represented by their invariant core and adjacent
   registry entries.
2. **Guidance writes are serialized and collision-safe.** Guard the read-modify-write
   sequence with a process lock and use a unique sibling temp file followed by
   `os.replace`; enforce the 4,000-character cap in the storage function as well as the
   API schema. This prevents concurrent per-agent saves from losing each other or
   colliding on one fixed `.tmp` path.
3. **Custom template identifiers are validated once, everywhere.** A bare custom stem
   must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`; dots, separators, empty stems, `.` and `..`
   are rejected. Upload, resolution, preview, delete, and config PUT all use the same
   validator before constructing a path, and the resolved path must remain beneath the
   tenant custom-template directory.
4. **Uploads validate before replacing live data.** Write candidate bytes to a unique
   temporary `.typ` sibling inside the custom-template directory, compile that candidate
   with its root pinned to the directory, then atomically replace the final file only on
   success. On failure remove only the candidate, preserving any existing valid template.
5. **Bundled paths are independent of CWD.** Manifest paths are absolute paths derived
   from the repository/package location. Tenant tests and API workers may change CWD;
   bundled resolution and previews must still work.
6. **All compile failures use the API envelope.** Both upload validation and preview
   compilation translate Typst/runtime failures to `TemplateValidationError`, returned
   as 422 `template_invalid`; they must never leak as an unhandled 500.
7. **Authenticated web requests reuse the client auth contract.** Multipart upload and
   preview fetches add the same bearer header as `api` (via a shared exported helper),
   not cookie-only authentication. Preview opens a blank window synchronously from the
   click before awaiting bytes, then navigates it to the object URL and revokes that URL
   later, avoiding popup blocking and leaks.
8. **Legacy config projection is explicit.** `GET /api/config/render` maps a legacy YAML
   document with no `template` key to `{template: "classic", fitOnePage: true}` without
   exposing or rewriting `template_path`/`output_dir`. Runtime `RenderConfig` continues
   to honor legacy fields; web PUT writes only new fields.
9. **Final verification checks generated drift against a regenerated baseline.** After
   regeneration, run the OpenAPI drift test and `git diff --check`; do not use
   `git diff --exit-code contracts ...` against the feature branch's intentional contract
   changes. The final sweep also includes full Python tests, Ruff, full web tests, web
   lint, web build, and a browser user-story check for both settings pages.

### Task 1: Prompt registry (`prompts/registry.py`)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/prompts/__init__.py` (empty)
- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/prompts/registry.py`
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/interview/agent.py` (extract `_PERSONA_CORE` from `persona_instructions`)
- Test: `tests/test_prompt_registry.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: instruction constants from existing agent modules (see table in Step 3).
- Produces: `PromptSpec` (frozen dataclass: `key: str`, `title: str`, `stage: str`, `description: str`, `instructions: tuple[str, ...]`, `editable: bool`), `PROMPT_SPECS: tuple[PromptSpec, ...]`, `SPECS_BY_KEY: dict[str, PromptSpec]`, `spec_for(key: str) -> PromptSpec | None`. Also `interview.agent._PERSONA_CORE: list[str]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python
# tests/test_prompt_registry.py
"""Registry is a projection of real agent instruction lists — never a copy."""

from resume_tailor_harness.prompts.registry import PROMPT_SPECS, SPECS_BY_KEY, spec_for

VALID_STAGES = {"tailoring", "review", "cover-letter", "discovery", "profile", "interview", "email"}


def test_keys_unique_and_lookup_matches():
    keys = [s.key for s in PROMPT_SPECS]
    assert len(keys) == len(set(keys))
    assert set(SPECS_BY_KEY) == set(keys)
    assert spec_for("tailor-writer") is SPECS_BY_KEY["tailor-writer"]
    assert spec_for("nope") is None


def test_every_spec_is_complete():
    for spec in PROMPT_SPECS:
        assert spec.stage in VALID_STAGES, spec.key
        assert spec.title and spec.description, spec.key
        assert len(spec.instructions) > 0, spec.key
        assert all(isinstance(line, str) and line for line in spec.instructions), spec.key


def test_fact_check_is_the_only_locked_agent():
    locked = {s.key for s in PROMPT_SPECS if not s.editable}
    assert locked == {"reviewer-fact-check"}


def test_registry_projects_the_real_instruction_objects():
    """Identity (not equality): the registry must import the module constant, not copy text."""
    from resume_tailor_harness.discovery import fit
    from resume_tailor_harness.tailor import agents as tailor_agents

    assert SPECS_BY_KEY["fit-score"].instructions == tuple(fit._INSTRUCTIONS)
    assert SPECS_BY_KEY["reviewer-fact-check"].instructions == tuple(
        tailor_agents.REVIEWER_INSTRUCTIONS["fact-check"]
    )


def test_interviewer_registers_the_persona_core():
    from resume_tailor_harness.interview.agent import _PERSONA_CORE

    assert SPECS_BY_KEY["interviewer"].instructions == tuple(_PERSONA_CORE)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_prompt_registry.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'resume_tailor_harness.prompts'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Extract `_PERSONA_CORE` in `interview/agent.py`**

`persona_instructions(style)` (line ~256) currently builds one inline list: four dynamic lines (stage sentence, `_STAGE_LINES[...]`, `_DEMEANOR_LINES[...]`, difficulty sentence) followed by static lines ("Ground questions in the JOB description…", the competency-mix line, the STAR line, and any remaining static literals up to the function's return). Move the static lines verbatim into a module-level constant directly above the function, and rebuild:

```python
_PERSONA_CORE = [
    # ... the static string literals moved verbatim from persona_instructions ...
]


def persona_instructions(style: InterviewStyle) -> list[str]:
    return [
        f"You are conducting a realistic mock {style.stage} interview.",
        _STAGE_LINES[style.stage],
        _DEMEANOR_LINES[style.demeanor],
        f"Difficulty: {style.difficulty}. Calibrate question depth accordingly.",
        *_PERSONA_CORE,
    ]
```

Only lines containing f-string interpolation stay inline; everything else moves. Run the interview tests to prove no behavior change: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/ -q -k interview` — expected PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the registry**

```python
# src/resume_tailor_harness/prompts/registry.py
"""Declarative projection of every LLM agent's base prompt.

Instruction lists stay defined in their home modules; this registry imports
them, so the viewer can never drift from the code (same pattern as
CONNECTOR_SPECS). ``editable`` derives from guidance.NON_EDITABLE_KEYS —
guidance.py must never import this module (see CLAUDE.md import-cycle rule).

NON_EDITABLE_KEYS = frozenset({"reviewer-fact-check"})
```

Task 2 fills in the rest of that file. If any `_INSTRUCTIONS` constant name above does not match the module (verify with `grep -n "_INSTRUCTIONS" <file>`), use the module's actual module-level constant that the builder passes to `Agent(instructions=...)` — never paste text into the registry.

### Task 2: Guidance store + `with_guidance` (`prompts/guidance.py`)

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/prompts/guidance.py` (extend the Task-1 stub)
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/tenancy/paths.py` (add `AGENT_GUIDANCE_PATH`)
- Test: `tests/test_prompt_guidance.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `resolve_tenant_path` from `tenancy/paths.py`.
- Produces: `AGENT_GUIDANCE_PATH = "config/agent_guidance.yaml"` (in `tenancy/paths.py`); in `guidance.py`: `NON_EDITABLE_KEYS: frozenset[str]`, `MAX_GUIDANCE_CHARS = 4000`, `GUIDANCE_HEADER: str`, `load_guidance() -> dict[str, str]`, `guidance_for(key: str) -> str | None`, `save_guidance(key: str, text: str) -> dict[str, str]`, `with_guidance(key: str, base: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]`.

### Task 3: Wire `with_guidance` into every agent builder

**Files:**

- Modify: every builder listed in the table below
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/tailor/agents.py` (`_merged_advisory_instructions` per-reviewer guidance)
- Test: `tests/test_prompt_injection.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `with_guidance(key, base)`, `guidance_for(key)` from Task 2; registry keys from Task 1.
- Produces: no new names — every built agent's `instructions` end with `[GUIDANCE_HEADER, text]` when guidance exists.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python
# tests/test_prompt_injection.py
"""Guidance written to the workspace reaches built agents, last in the prompt."""

import yaml

from resume_tailor_harness.prompts.guidance import GUIDANCE_HEADER


def _write_guidance(tmp_path, data):
    config = tmp_path / "config"
    config.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    (config / "agent_guidance.yaml").write_text(yaml.safe_dump(data), encoding="utf-8")


def test_reviewer_agent_receives_guidance(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)
    _write_guidance(tmp_path, {"reviewer-recruiter": "Weight the summary heavily."})
    from resume_tailor_harness.tailor.agents import build_reviewer_agent

    runner = build_reviewer_agent("recruiter")
    instructions = list(runner._agent.instructions)
    assert instructions[-2] == GUIDANCE_HEADER
    assert instructions[-1] == "Weight the summary heavily."


def test_fact_check_agent_never_receives_guidance(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)
    _write_guidance(tmp_path, {"reviewer-fact-check": "be lenient"})
    from resume_tailor_harness.tailor.agents import build_reviewer_agent

    runner = build_reviewer_agent("fact-check")
    assert GUIDANCE_HEADER not in list(runner._agent.instructions)


def test_fit_agent_receives_guidance(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)
    _write_guidance(tmp_path, {"fit-score": "Penalize on-site-only roles."})
    from resume_tailor_harness.discovery.fit import build_fit_agent

    runner = build_fit_agent()
    instructions = list(runner._agent.instructions)
    assert instructions[-1] == "Penalize on-site-only roles."


def test_merged_advisory_embeds_per_reviewer_guidance(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)
    _write_guidance(tmp_path, {"reviewer-recruiter": "Weight the summary heavily."})
    from resume_tailor_harness.tailor.agents import _merged_advisory_instructions

    lines = _merged_advisory_instructions(["recruiter", "concision"])
    recruiter_rubric = next(l for l in lines if l.startswith("Rubric for 'recruiter'"))
    concision_rubric = next(l for l in lines if l.startswith("Rubric for 'concision'"))
    assert "Weight the summary heavily." in recruiter_rubric
    assert "Weight the summary heavily." not in concision_rubric
```

Note: `build_fit_agent` — use the actual builder function name in `discovery/fit.py` (the function containing `Agent(instructions=_INSTRUCTIONS, ...)` at line ~68); adjust the import if it differs. Builders construct plain agno objects — no key or network needed. Guidance loading happens at **build time**, which is per-call in this codebase (builders are invoked per run), so no caching concerns.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_prompt_injection.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — guidance text absent from instructions.

- [ ] **Step 3: Wire the sites**

The transformation is identical everywhere: wrap the final composed instruction list in `with_guidance("<key>", ...)`, importing `from resume_tailor_harness.prompts.guidance import with_guidance` at each module top. Exact key ↔ site map:

| File                                       | Site                               | Wrap                                                                                                               |

For the merged advisory panel, edit `_merged_advisory_instructions` in `tailor/agents.py` — after building `rubric` for each name, append that reviewer's guidance into its rubric line:

```python
from resume_tailor_harness.prompts.guidance import guidance_for, with_guidance  # module top

    for name in names:
        rubric = [
            *([_SCORE_BAND_INSTRUCTION] if bands.get(name, False) else []),
            *REVIEWER_INSTRUCTIONS.get(name, _DEFAULT_REVIEWER_INSTRUCTIONS),
            *CRAFT_REVIEWERS.get(name, []),
        ]
        guidance = guidance_for(f"reviewer-{name}")
        if guidance:
            rubric.append(
                f"User guidance for {name!r} (governs HOW, never WHAT is true): {guidance}"
            )
        instructions.append(f"Rubric for {name!r}: " + " ".join(rubric))
```

(`guidance_for` already returns `None` for `reviewer-fact-check`, and fact-check never appears in advisory rosters.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the full backend suite**

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q`
Expected: PASS (existing agent tests unaffected — guidance file absent means `with_guidance` is identity). Then `ruff check` — clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add -A src tests/test_prompt_injection.py
git commit -m "feat(prompts): layer user guidance into every agent builder"
```

### Task 4: Prompts API (`GET /api/agents/prompts`, `PUT /api/agents/prompts/{key}`)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/schemas/prompts.py`
- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/routers/prompts.py`
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/app.py` (include router, guarded)
- Modify: `contracts/openapi.json`, `contracts/ts/api.ts`, `web/src/lib/api/schema.ts` (regenerated)
- Test: `tests/api/test_prompts_api.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `PROMPT_SPECS`, `spec_for` (Task 1); `guidance_for` raw map via `load_guidance`, `save_guidance`, `MAX_GUIDANCE_CHARS` (Task 2); `ApiException` (`api/errors.py`).
- Produces: wire schemas `AgentPromptItem` (`key, title, stage, description, instructions: list[str], guidance: str | null, editable: bool`) and `GuidanceUpdate` (`guidance: str`, max length 4000); routes above.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python

    resp = client.put("/api/agents/prompts/coach", json={"guidance": "x" * 4001})
    assert resp.status_code == 422
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/api/test_prompts_api.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — 404 on `/api/agents/prompts` (route missing).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement schemas + router**

```python
# src/resume_tailor_harness/api/schemas/prompts.py
"""Wire contract for agent prompt transparency + guidance editing."""

from pydantic import Field

from resume_tailor_harness.api.schemas.base import CamelModel


class AgentPromptItem(CamelModel):
    key: str
    title: str
    stage: str
    description: str
    instructions: list[str]
    guidance: str | None = None
    editable: bool


class GuidanceUpdate(CamelModel):
    guidance: str = Field(max_length=4000)
```

```python
# src/resume_tailor_harness/api/routers/prompts.py
"""Agent prompt transparency: view every base prompt, edit the guidance layer."""

from fastapi import APIRouter

from resume_tailor_harness.api.errors import ApiException
from resume_tailor_harness.api.schemas.prompts import AgentPromptItem, GuidanceUpdate
from resume_tailor_harness.prompts.guidance import load_guidance, save_guidance
from resume_tailor_harness.prompts.registry import PROMPT_SPECS, spec_for

router = APIRouter()


def _item(spec, guidance_map: dict[str, str]) -> AgentPromptItem:
    return AgentPromptItem(
        key=spec.key,
        title=spec.title,
        stage=spec.stage,
        description=spec.description,
        instructions=list(spec.instructions),
        guidance=guidance_map.get(spec.key) if spec.editable else None,
        editable=spec.editable,
    )


@router.get("/agents/prompts", response_model=list[AgentPromptItem])
def list_prompts() -> list[AgentPromptItem]:
    guidance_map = load_guidance()

        )
    saved = save_guidance(key, body.guidance)
    return _item(spec, saved)
```

In `api/app.py`, import the router alongside the others (`from resume_tailor_harness.api.routers import prompts as prompts_router`) and include it next to the config router (line ~290):

```python
app.include_router(prompts_router.router, prefix="/api", dependencies=guarded)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests, regenerate contracts**

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/api/test_prompts_api.py -q` — expected PASS.
Run: `bash scripts/gen_ts_client.sh` then `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/api/test_openapi_contract.py -q` — expected PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/resume_tailor_harness/api tests/api/test_prompts_api.py contracts web/src/lib/api/schema.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): agent prompt transparency + guidance endpoints"
```

### Task 5: Review structural knobs (`merged_advisory`, writer tiers) in contract + web

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/schemas/config.py` (`ReviewConfigDoc`)
- Modify: `web/src/features/settings/pages/ReviewSettingsPage.tsx`
- Modify: `contracts/*`, `web/src/lib/api/schema.ts` (regenerated)
- Test: `tests/api/test_config_router.py` (extend), `web/src/features/settings/pages/ReviewSettingsPage.test.tsx` (create if absent)

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: existing `ReviewConfigDoc`, `useConfig`/`useSaveConfig`.
- Produces: `ReviewConfigDoc.merged_advisory: bool = False`, `tailor_tier: Literal["cheap","mid","premium"] = "premium"`, `reviser_tier: Literal["cheap","mid","premium"] = "premium"` (wire: `mergedAdvisory`, `tailorTier`, `reviserTier`). These names mirror `tailor/review_config.py:31-33`, which already reads them from `review.yaml` — the Doc addition makes the web PUT stop silently dropping them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing backend test** — append to `tests/api/test_config_router.py`:

```python
def test_review_structural_knobs_round_trip(client):
    body = client.get("/api/config/review").json()
    assert body["mergedAdvisory"] is False
    assert body["tailorTier"] == "premium"
    put = client.put("/api/config/review", json={
        **body, "mergedAdvisory": True, "tailorTier": "mid", "reviserTier": "mid",
    })
    assert put.status_code == 200
    saved = client.get("/api/config/review").json()
    assert saved["mergedAdvisory"] is True and saved["reviserTier"] == "mid"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails** — `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/api/test_config_router.py -q` → FAIL (`KeyError: 'mergedAdvisory'`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — in `api/schemas/config.py` add to `ReviewConfigDoc` (import `Literal` from `typing`):

```python
class ReviewConfigDoc(CamelModel):
    max_rounds: int = 3
    score_threshold: int = 85
    merged_advisory: bool = False
    tailor_tier: Literal["cheap", "mid", "premium"] = "premium"
    reviser_tier: Literal["cheap", "mid", "premium"] = "premium"
    reviewers: list[ReviewerEntry] = Field(default_factory=_default_reviewers)
    length_budget: LengthBudget | None = None
```

Run the test → PASS. Regenerate contracts: `bash scripts/gen_ts_client.sh`; run `tests/api/test_openapi_contract.py` → PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Web — extend `ReviewSettingsPage.tsx`**

Below the Max rounds / threshold fields, add a "Pipeline" `FieldGroup` with:

- a `Switch` bound to `draft.mergedAdvisory` labeled "Merge advisory reviews into one call" with description "Faster and cheaper; turn off to run each advisory reviewer separately."
- two `ToggleGroup`s (same component pattern the page already uses for `modelTier`, line ~94) bound to `draft.tailorTier` and `draft.reviserTier`, labeled "Writer model tier" and "Reviser model tier", options cheap/mid/premium.

Write `ReviewSettingsPage.test.tsx` following the pattern of `web/src/features/settings/pages/PruningSettingsPage.test.tsx` (mock `use-config` hooks, render, assert the switch and both toggle groups appear and that toggling marks the draft dirty).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run web tests** — `cd web && npx vitest run src/features/settings/pages/ReviewSettingsPage.test.tsx` → PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/resume_tailor_harness/api/schemas/config.py tests/api/test_config_router.py contracts web
git commit -m "feat(review): expose merged-advisory + writer tiers in contract and settings UI"
```

### Task 6: Web — Agent Prompts settings page

**Files:**

- Create: `web/src/features/settings/use-prompts.ts`
- Create: `web/src/features/settings/pages/AgentPromptsPage.tsx`
- Create: `web/src/features/settings/pages/AgentPromptsPage.test.tsx`
- Modify: `web/src/app/router.tsx` (lazy route `agent-prompts`), `web/src/features/settings/SettingsLayout.tsx` (`SETTINGS_NAV` entry)

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `/api/agents/prompts` GET/PUT from the regenerated `schema.ts`; `api`, `unwrap` from `@/lib/api/client`.
- Produces: `usePrompts(): UseQueryResult<AgentPromptItem[]>`, `useSaveGuidance(): UseMutationResult` (mutate `{key, guidance}`); route `/settings/agent-prompts`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing component test**

```tsx
// web/src/features/settings/pages/AgentPromptsPage.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";

import { AgentPromptsPage } from "./AgentPromptsPage";

const items = [
  {
    key: "tailor-writer",
    title: "Resume writer",
    stage: "tailoring",
    description: "Writes the targeted resume.",
    instructions: ["Rule one.", "Rule two."],
    guidance: null,
    editable: true,
  },
  {
    key: "reviewer-fact-check",
    title: "Fact-check gate",
    stage: "review",
    description: "Hard gate.",
    instructions: ["Verify claims."],
    guidance: null,
    editable: false,
  },
];
const save = vi.fn();

vi.mock("../use-prompts", () => ({
  usePrompts: () => ({ data: items, isLoading: false }),
  useSaveGuidance: () => ({ mutate: save, isPending: false }),
}));

describe("AgentPromptsPage", () => {
  it("groups agents by stage and shows base prompts read-only", async () => {
    render(<AgentPromptsPage />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Resume writer")).toBeInTheDocument();
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText("Resume writer"));
    expect(screen.getByText("Rule one.")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("locks integrity gates", async () => {
    render(<AgentPromptsPage />);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText("Fact-check gate"));
    expect(screen.getByText(/integrity gate/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.queryByLabelText(/your guidance/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("saves guidance for editable agents", async () => {
    render(<AgentPromptsPage />);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText("Resume writer"));
    await userEvent.type(
      screen.getByLabelText(/your guidance/i),
      "Punchy verbs.",
    );
    await userEvent.click(
      screen.getByRole("button", { name: /save guidance/i }),
    );
    expect(save).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      key: "tailor-writer",
      guidance: "Punchy verbs.",
    });
  });
});
```

Run: `cd web && npx vitest run src/features/settings/pages/AgentPromptsPage.test.tsx` — expected FAIL (module missing).

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement hooks**

```ts
// web/src/features/settings/use-prompts.ts
import { useMutation, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { toast } from "sonner";

import { api, unwrap } from "@/lib/api/client";
import type { paths } from "@/lib/api/schema";

export type AgentPromptItem =
  paths["/api/agents/prompts"]["get"]["responses"][200]["content"]["application/json"][number];

export function usePrompts() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["agent-prompts"],
    queryFn: () =>
      unwrap(api.GET("/api/agents/prompts")) as Promise<AgentPromptItem[]>,
  });
}

export function useSaveGuidance() {
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: ({ key, guidance }: { key: string; guidance: string }) =>
      unwrap(
        api.PUT("/api/agents/prompts/{key}", {
          params: { path: { key } },
          body: { guidance },
        } as never),
      ) as Promise<AgentPromptItem>,
    onSuccess: () => {
      qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["agent-prompts"] });
      toast.success("Guidance saved");
    },
    onError: (err: Error) => toast.error(err.message),
  });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the page**

`AgentPromptsPage.tsx` structure (use existing shadcn components: `Accordion`/`Collapsible` if present in `web/src/components/ui/`, else `<details>`-style Cards — follow whatever disclosure component other pages use):

- Header: title "Agent prompts", subtitle "Read every agent's built-in prompt and add your own guidance. Guidance is appended beneath the built-in rules — it can steer tone, emphasis, and process, never facts."
- Group `usePrompts().data` by `stage` in fixed order `["tailoring", "review", "cover-letter", "discovery", "profile", "interview", "email"]` with headings (Tailoring, Review, Cover letters, Discovery, Profile, Interview, Email).
- Each agent: a disclosure row (trigger shows `title` + `description`; content shows `instructions` as an `<ol>` of read-only items in `text-sm text-muted-foreground font-mono`).
- If `editable`: a `Textarea` (`aria-label`/`FieldLabel` "Your guidance", `maxLength={4000}`) initialized from `guidance ?? ""`, local state per row, and a "Save guidance" `Button` calling `useSaveGuidance().mutate({ key, guidance })`, disabled while pending or when unchanged.
- If not `editable`: a `Badge` reading "Integrity gate — read-only" and no textarea.

- [ ] **Step 4: Register route + nav**

`router.tsx`: add a lazy import in the style of the existing ones and route `{ path: "agent-prompts", element: page(<AgentPromptsPage />) }` inside the settings children (line ~140). `SettingsLayout.tsx`: add `{ to: "/settings/agent-prompts", label: "Agent prompts", icon: Bot }` to `SETTINGS_NAV` after the "Review panel" entry (`import { Bot } from "lucide-react"`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run web tests** — `cd web && npx vitest run src/features/settings` → PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add web/src
git commit -m "feat(web): Agent Prompts settings page — view prompts, edit guidance"
```

### Task 7: Render template manifest + sample content (`render/templates.py`)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/templates.py`
- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/sample_content.py`
- Test: `tests/test_render_templates.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `resolve_tenant_path`; `RenderConfig` (current shape; Task 8 extends it).
- Produces:
  - `TemplateInfo` frozen dataclass: `id: str`, `title: str`, `description: str`, `kind: str` (`"bundled" | "custom"`), `path: Path`
  - `BUNDLED: dict[str, TemplateInfo]` (one entry, id `"classic"`, path `templates/resume.typ`)
  - `CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_DIR = "config/templates"` (workspace-relative)
  - `class TemplateNotFoundError(Exception)`
  - `resolve_template(template_id: str) -> TemplateInfo` (raises `TemplateNotFoundError`)
  - `list_templates() -> list[TemplateInfo]` (bundled first, then custom `*.typ` sorted by stem)
  - `sample_resume_content() -> ResumeContent` (in `sample_content.py`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

### Task 8: `RenderConfig` new keys + root-pinned `render_pdf` + service wiring

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/render_config.py`
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/renderer.py` (`render_pdf` gains `root`)
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/service.py` (`render_version` resolves template + fit)
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/templates.py` (add `template_path_for`)
- Test: `tests/test_render_config.py` (create; move/extend any existing render-config assertions), existing render service tests (update fakes)

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `resolve_template`, `TemplateNotFoundError` (Task 7).
- Produces:
  - `RenderConfig`: `template: str | None = None`, `fit_one_page: bool = True`, `template_path: str | None = None` (legacy), `output_dir: str = "output"` (legacy/CLI, unchanged semantics)
  - `template_path_for(config: RenderConfig) -> Path` in `render/templates.py`: `template` set → `resolve_template(...)`; else `template_path` set → `Path(template_path)` (legacy escape hatch); else classic.
  - `render_pdf(..., root: str | Path | None = None)` — when `None`, root defaults to the template file's parent directory (root-pinning always on).
  - `render/service.py` calls `render_fn(content, out_path, template, fit_pages=1 if config.fit_one_page else None)`; `RenderFn = Callable[..., Path]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python
# tests/test_render_config.py
"""New template id keys; legacy render.yaml keys keep loading."""

from pathlib import Path

import yaml

from resume_tailor_harness.render.render_config import RenderConfig, load_render_config
from resume_tailor_harness.render.templates import template_path_for


def test_defaults_use_classic_template():
    config = RenderConfig()
    assert config.template is None and config.template_path is None
    assert template_path_for(config) == Path("templates/resume.typ")
    assert config.fit_one_page is True


def test_new_keys_load(tmp_path):
    path = tmp_path / "render.yaml"
    path.write_text(yaml.safe_dump({"template": "classic", "fit_one_page": False}))
    config = load_render_config(path)
    assert config.template == "classic" and config.fit_one_page is False


def test_legacy_template_path_wins_when_template_absent(tmp_path):
    path = tmp_path / "render.yaml"
    path.write_text(
        yaml.safe_dump({"template_path": "my/local.typ", "output_dir": "out"})
    )
    config = load_render_config(path)
    assert template_path_for(config) == Path("my/local.typ")
    assert config.output_dir == "out"


def test_template_key_beats_legacy_path(tmp_path):
    path = tmp_path / "render.yaml"
    path.write_text(
        yaml.safe_dump({"template": "classic", "template_path": "my/local.typ"})
    )
    assert template_path_for(load_render_config(path)) == Path("templates/resume.typ")
```

Also update the render service test file (find it: `grep -rl "render_version" tests/`) — its fake `render_fn` must accept the new call shape; change fakes to `def fake_render(content, out_path, template_path, *, fit_pages=None): ...` and add one assertion that `fit_pages == 1` by default and `None` when the config says `fit_one_page=False`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure** — `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_render_config.py -q` → FAIL (`template` attribute missing).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`render/render_config.py`:

```python
class RenderConfig(ExtensibleModel):
    template: str | None = None       # "classic" | "custom:<stem>"; None → legacy/default
    fit_one_page: bool = True
    template_path: str | None = None  # legacy escape hatch (CLI, pre-migration yaml)
    output_dir: str = "output"        # legacy/CLI; web output is workspace-resolved
```

Add to `render/templates.py`:

```python
def template_path_for(config) -> Path:
    """Template id wins; legacy template_path is the CLI escape hatch."""
    if config.template:
        return resolve_template(config.template).path
    if config.template_path:
        return Path(config.template_path)
    return resolve_template("classic").path
```

`render/renderer.py` — `render_pdf` gains `root: str | Path | None = None` after `zoom_step`; before the compile loop:

```python
    resolved_root = Path(root) if root is not None else Path(template_path).resolve().parent
```

and the compile call becomes:

```python
        typst.compile(
            str(template_path),
            output=str(out),
            root=str(resolved_root),
            sys_inputs={"data": data, "zoom": f"{zoom:.4f}"},
        )
```

Note: with `root` set, Typst resolves the input path against the root when relative — pass `str(Path(template_path).resolve())` as the input to keep absolute/relative templates working; verify with the bundled template test below.

`render/service.py`:

```python
from resume_tailor_harness.render.templates import template_path_for

RenderFn = Callable[..., Path]

    # inside render_version, replacing the render_fn(...) call:
    template = template_path_for(config)
    render_fn(
        content, out_path, template,
        fit_pages=1 if config.fit_one_page else None,
    )
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Prove a real compile still works** — add to `tests/test_render_config.py`:

```python
def test_classic_template_compiles_with_pinned_root(tmp_path):
    from resume_tailor_harness.render.renderer import render_pdf
    from resume_tailor_harness.render.sample_content import sample_resume_content

    out = render_pdf(
        sample_resume_content(), tmp_path / "sample.pdf",
        "templates/resume.typ", fit_pages=None,
    )
    assert out.exists() and out.stat().st_size > 0
```

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_render_config.py -q` and the full suite `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q` → PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/resume_tailor_harness/render tests
git commit -m "feat(render): template-id config keys, root-pinned compile, fit toggle"
```

### Task 9: `RenderConfigDoc` contract swap + PUT validation + example file

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/schemas/config.py` (`RenderConfigDoc`)
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/routers/config.py` (`put_render` validates the template id)
- Modify: `config/render.yaml.example` (create if absent — check first)
- Modify: `contracts/*`, `web/src/lib/api/schema.ts` (regenerated)
- Test: `tests/api/test_config_router.py` (extend)

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `resolve_template`, `TemplateNotFoundError` (Task 7).
- Produces: `RenderConfigDoc(template: str = "classic", fit_one_page: bool = True)` — wire `{template, fitOnePage}`; `template_path`/`output_dir` leave the wire contract. PUT with a nonexistent template → 422 `template_not_found`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests** — append to `tests/api/test_config_router.py`:

```python
def test_render_contract_is_template_id_only(client):
    body = client.get("/api/config/render").json()
    assert body == {"template": "classic", "fitOnePage": True}


def test_put_render_rejects_unknown_template(client):
    resp = client.put(
        "/api/config/render", json={"template": "custom:ghost", "fitOnePage": True}
    )
    assert resp.status_code == 422
    assert resp.json()["error"]["code"] == "template_not_found"


def test_put_render_round_trip(client):
    put = client.put(
        "/api/config/render", json={"template": "classic", "fitOnePage": False}
    )
    assert put.status_code == 200
    assert client.get("/api/config/render").json()["fitOnePage"] is False
```

Run → FAIL (old keys in GET body).

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement**

`api/schemas/config.py`:

```python
class RenderConfigDoc(CamelModel):
    template: str = "classic"
    fit_one_page: bool = True
```

`api/routers/config.py` — replace `put_render`:

```python
from resume_tailor_harness.api.errors import ApiException
from resume_tailor_harness.render.templates import TemplateNotFoundError, resolve_template

@router.put("/config/render", response_model=RenderConfigDoc)
def put_render(body: RenderConfigDoc, request: Request):
    try:
        resolve_template(body.template)
    except TemplateNotFoundError as exc:
        raise ApiException(422, "template_not_found", str(exc))
    return _store(request).put("render", body)
```

Because `RenderConfig` (Task 8) still accepts `template`/`fit_one_page` alongside legacy keys, the yaml written by `ConfigStore.put` loads cleanly in `services/rendering._load_config`. A legacy `render.yaml` served through GET now validates through the new Doc — legacy keys are simply not projected (ExtensibleModel/`model_validate` ignores or carries extras; assert GET on a legacy file returns defaults in a quick test if `CamelModel` forbids extras, adjust with `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="ignore")` on `RenderConfigDoc` only if validation errors).

Update `config/render.yaml.example` (or create):

```yaml
# Rendering: pick a template by id and whether to shrink-to-fit one page.
# Bundled: classic. Uploaded templates are custom:<name>.
# Legacy keys template_path / output_dir still load for CLI setups.
template: classic
fit_one_page: true
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run tests + regenerate** — `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/api/test_config_router.py -q` → PASS. `bash scripts/gen_ts_client.sh`; `tests/api/test_openapi_contract.py` → PASS. Note: `RenderingSettingsPage.tsx` now fails typecheck (old field names) — that is expected until Task 11; if `npx tsc`/vitest runs in CI for this commit, update the page minimally in this task by replacing the two fields with a placeholder reading `draft.template` (Task 11 rewrites it fully).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/resume_tailor_harness/api config/render.yaml.example tests contracts web/src
git commit -m "feat(api)!: render config contract is template id + fitOnePage"
```

### Task 10: Template management endpoints (list / upload / delete / preview)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/services/render_templates.py`
- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/routers/render_templates.py`
- Create: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/schemas/render_templates.py`
- Modify: `src/resume_tailor_harness/api/app.py` (include router, guarded)
- Modify: `contracts/*`, `web/src/lib/api/schema.ts` (regenerated)
- Test: `tests/api/test_render_templates_api.py`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `list_templates`, `resolve_template`, `TemplateNotFoundError`, `CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_DIR` (Task 7); `render_pdf` (Task 8); `sample_resume_content`; `read_upload`/`UploadTooLargeError` (`api/uploads.py`); `ConfigStore` via `get_config_store` (`api/deps.py`).
- Produces:
  - `services/render_templates.py`: `class TemplateValidationError(Exception)` (message = Typst error text), `validate_template(path: Path) -> None`, `save_custom_template(filename: str, data: bytes) -> TemplateInfo`, `delete_custom_template(stem: str, store) -> bool`, `render_preview(template_id: str) -> bytes`
  - Routes: `GET /api/config/render/templates` → `list[TemplateListItem]` (`{id, title, description, kind}`); `POST /api/config/render/templates` (multipart `file`) → `TemplateListItem`; `DELETE /api/config/render/templates/{stem}` → 204; `GET /api/config/render/templates/{template_id}/preview` → `application/pdf` bytes.

### Task 11: Web — Rendering settings rewrite (picker + upload + fit switch)

**Files:**

- Rewrite: `web/src/features/settings/pages/RenderingSettingsPage.tsx`
- Create: `web/src/features/settings/use-render-templates.ts`
- Create: `web/src/features/settings/pages/RenderingSettingsPage.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `/api/config/render` (new shape) via `useConfig`/`useSaveConfig`; `/api/config/render/templates` GET/POST/DELETE from `schema.ts`.
- Produces: `useRenderTemplates()`, `useUploadTemplate()` (mutate `File`), `useDeleteTemplate()` (mutate `stem: string`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing component test**

```tsx
// web/src/features/settings/pages/RenderingSettingsPage.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";

import { RenderingSettingsPage } from "./RenderingSettingsPage";

const saveMutate = vi.fn();
const uploadMutate = vi.fn();

vi.mock("../use-config", () => ({
  useConfig: () => ({ data: { template: "classic", fitOnePage: true } }),
  useSaveConfig: () => ({ mutate: saveMutate, isPending: false }),
}));
vi.mock("../use-render-templates", () => ({
  useRenderTemplates: () => ({
    data: [
      {
        id: "classic",
        title: "Classic",
        description: "Single column.",
        kind: "bundled",
      },
      {
        id: "custom:mine",
        title: "mine",
        description: "Uploaded template",
        kind: "custom",
      },
    ],
  }),
  useUploadTemplate: () => ({
    mutate: uploadMutate,
    isPending: false,
    error: null,
  }),
  useDeleteTemplate: () => ({ mutate: vi.fn(), isPending: false }),
}));

describe("RenderingSettingsPage", () => {
  it("shows template cards with no path inputs", () => {
    render(<RenderingSettingsPage />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Classic")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText("mine")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.queryByLabelText(/path|directory/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("selecting a template marks the draft dirty and saves", async () => {
    render(<RenderingSettingsPage />);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole("radio", { name: /mine/i }));
    await userEvent.click(
      screen.getByRole("button", { name: /save changes/i }),
    );
    expect(saveMutate).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      template: "custom:mine",
      fitOnePage: true,
    });
  });

  it("toggling one-page fit updates the draft", async () => {
    render(<RenderingSettingsPage />);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole("switch", { name: /one page/i }));
    await userEvent.click(
      screen.getByRole("button", { name: /save changes/i }),
    );
    expect(saveMutate).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      template: "classic",
      fitOnePage: false,
    });
  });
});
```

Run: `cd web && npx vitest run src/features/settings/pages/RenderingSettingsPage.test.tsx` → FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement hooks**

```ts
// web/src/features/settings/use-render-templates.ts
import { useMutation, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { toast } from "sonner";

import { api, unwrap } from "@/lib/api/client";
import type { paths } from "@/lib/api/schema";

export type TemplateListItem =
  paths["/api/config/render/templates"]["get"]["responses"][200]["content"]["application/json"][number];

const KEY = ["render-templates"];

export function useRenderTemplates() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: KEY,
    queryFn: () =>
      unwrap(api.GET("/api/config/render/templates")) as Promise<
        TemplateListItem[]
      >,
  });
}

export function useUploadTemplate() {
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (file: File) => {
      const body = new FormData();
      body.append("file", file);
      const resp = await fetch("/api/config/render/templates", {
        method: "POST",
        body,
        credentials: "include",
      });
      const json = await resp.json();
      if (!resp.ok) {
        const detail =
          json?.error?.details || json?.error?.message || "Upload failed";
        throw new Error(String(detail));
      }
      return json as TemplateListItem;
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: KEY });
      toast.success("Template uploaded");
    },
  });
}

export function useDeleteTemplate() {
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (stem: string) =>
      unwrap(
        api.DELETE("/api/config/render/templates/{stem}", {
          params: { path: { stem } },
        } as never),
      ),
    onSuccess: () => {
      qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: KEY });
      qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["config", "/api/config/render"] });
      toast.success("Template deleted");
    },
    onError: (err: Error) => toast.error(err.message),
  });
}
```

(Raw `fetch` for the multipart POST — openapi-fetch multipart typing is awkward; the app's auth is a same-origin session cookie, so `credentials: "include"` suffices. If the api client exposes a bearer header helper, reuse it here the way `web/src/lib/api/client.ts` builds headers.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite the page**

Structure of the new `RenderingSettingsPage.tsx`:

- Keep `useConfig("/api/config/render")` + `useDraft` + `SaveBar` exactly as the old page did (draft type is now `{template, fitOnePage}`).
- **Templates**: a radiogroup of Cards (one per `useRenderTemplates().data` entry): title, description, `kind === "custom"` badge; clicking sets `setDraft({...draft, template: item.id})`; the selected card gets a ring. Each card has a "Preview" link-button: `onClick` fetches `/api/config/render/templates/${encodeURIComponent(item.id)}/preview` with `credentials: "include"`, turns the blob into `URL.createObjectURL`, and `window.open`s it. Custom cards also render a small delete icon-button wired to `useDeleteTemplate().mutate(item.id.replace(/^custom:/, ""))`.
- **Upload**: `<Input type="file" accept=".typ" />`; on change call `useUploadTemplate().mutate(file)`; render `upload.error.message` beneath in `text-destructive text-sm whitespace-pre-wrap` (this is the verbatim Typst compile error). A `FieldDescription` documents the contract: "Your template must be a Typst file that reads `sys.inputs.data` (resume JSON) and `sys.inputs.zoom`."
- **Options**: a `Switch` (`aria-label` "Fit resume to one page") bound to `draft.fitOnePage`.
- Caption at the bottom: "Rendered PDFs are stored in your workspace and downloaded from each job's page."

- [ ] **Step 4: Run web tests** — `cd web && npx vitest run src/features/settings` → PASS. Also run the full web suite `cd web && npx vitest run` → PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add web/src
git commit -m "feat(web): rendering settings — template picker, validated upload, one-page fit"
```

### Task 12: Docs + full verification sweep

**Files:**

- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`
- Test: full suites

**Interfaces:** none new.

- [ ] **Step 1: CLAUDE.md updates**

Add to "Known design notes":

```markdown
- **Agent prompts are registry-projected; guidance is layered.** `prompts/registry.py`
  declares every agent's `PromptSpec` by importing the instruction lists from their
  home modules (never copying text). Per-agent user guidance lives in
  `config/agent_guidance.yaml` (constant `AGENT_GUIDANCE_PATH`), capped at 4000 chars,
  and is appended beneath base rules by `prompts/guidance.py:with_guidance` in every
  builder — it can steer tone/emphasis/process, never facts. `reviewer-fact-check` is
  the only non-editable key (`NON_EDITABLE_KEYS`); guidance.py must not import
  registry.py (registry imports the agent modules, which import guidance).
  API: `GET /api/agents/prompts`, `PUT /api/agents/prompts/{key}`.
- **Rendering is template-id based.** `RenderConfigDoc` is `{template, fitOnePage}`;
  `output_dir`/`template_path` are legacy yaml keys honored only for CLI setups
  (`render/templates.py:template_path_for`). Bundled templates live in the `BUNDLED`
  manifest; uploads land in `{workspace}/config/templates/` after a validation
  compile with Typst `root` pinned to the template's directory (`render_pdf` always
  pins root to the template's parent). Deleting the active custom template falls the
  config back to `classic` — the only fallback path; renders with a missing template
  fail with `template_not_found`.
```

Also update the hot-paths table only if a row references `render_config.py` semantics that changed (no row does today — skip otherwise).

- [ ] **Step 2: Full verification**

```
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q
ruff check
bash scripts/gen_ts_client.sh && git diff --exit-code contracts web/src/lib/api/schema.ts
cd web && npx vitest run
```

All green; the `git diff --exit-code` proves committed contracts match the code.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: agent prompt registry + template-id rendering in CLAUDE.md"
```

---

## Self-Review Notes (already applied)

- **Spec coverage:** registry/guidance/injection (Tasks 1–3), prompts API + page (4, 6), review knobs (5), template manifest/resolution (7), config + root-pinning + fit (8), contract swap + example (9), upload/delete/preview endpoints (10), rendering page (11), docs + error codes + drift gates (throughout, 12). Merged-advisory guidance embedding — spec's "each configured named rows" advisory model — handled explicitly in Task 3.
- **Type consistency:** `with_guidance(key, base) -> list[str]`; `TemplateInfo.id` carries the full `custom:<stem>` id; delete takes the bare stem; `RenderFn` relaxed to `Callable[..., Path]` in the same task that changes its call shape.
- **Known judgment calls:** `template: str | None` internally vs `template: str = "classic"` on the wire (absence detection for legacy yaml); registry imports service/agent modules at import time (already true of the test suite); preview/upload web calls use raw `fetch` with same-origin credentials.
