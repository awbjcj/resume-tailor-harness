 * The one place a finished run turns into user-visible effects.
 *
 * Mount once, at the app root. It lives in React rather than in the tracker
 * because it needs the QueryClient, and the tracker is a module singleton with
 * no business holding one — that inversion is what lets a completion found by
 * the poller, on page load, or over SSE all land here identically.
 *
 * Announcement runs before invalidation: a completion notice should never wait
 * on a board refetch, which is exactly what used to delay it past the moment
 * the progress bar disappeared.
