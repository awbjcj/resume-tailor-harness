"""Role-targeted craft guidance distilled from resume-writing playbooks.

These blocks teach HOW to write well; they never establish WHAT is true.
They are appended after the integrity (fact-lock) instructions and before
the user's house style, and must never contain wording that authorizes
inventing or embellishing evidence (guarded by tests/test_tailor_craft.py).
The fact-check reviewer deliberately has no entry here: it is the safety
gate, and holding its prompt fixed keeps trap-recall measurements
attributable to writer changes rather than checker drift.

    "Write every bullet as an accomplishment. When a cited profile fact supplies "
    "a number, lead with the outcome and its number, then the action that "
    "produced it. When the cited facts carry no number, lead with the concrete "
    "action, its scope, and the specific systems involved - that is a complete "
    "accomplishment bullet, not a lesser one, and inventing an outcome to fill "
    "the gap fails the round.",
    "Start bullets with strong past-tense verbs such as built, shipped, scaled, "
    "reduced, led, or designed only when the source supports that ownership. "
    "Use 'contributed to' or 'supported' when that is the truthful role; "
    "never upgrade participation to leadership for a stronger verb. Replace "
    "vague duty phrasing with the specific contribution the fact describes.",
    "Place the most role-relevant evidence in the top third of the resume, and "
    "order bullets within each role by relevance to this job rather than their "
    "original order.",
    "When a cited fact names the same thing the job names, prefer the job's "
    "exact term (a fact stating Amazon Web Services experience may be written "
    "as AWS); never relabel an adjacent or merely similar activity as the "
    "job's own term. Cover a must-have skill both as a skills-section entry "
    "and inside one supporting bullet when the evidence exists.",
    "When a cited fact supplies both endpoints of a change, write it as "
    "before-to-after (reduced p95 latency from 500ms to 200ms) rather than a "
    "bare percentage; a number persuades only with its baseline or scale "
    "context. Keep each bullet to one claim and at most three numbers.",

    "profile skill this job names, then every adjacent skill from the same "
    "stack, toolchain, or domain, each listed under its own true name from the "
    "cited fact - an adjacent skill named truthfully is a legitimate entry, "
    "renaming one to the job's own term is not. Then order by this job's "
    "priorities: must-have skills first, then supporting skills. Cut only "
    "low-signal entries (default office tools, tech irrelevant to this role); "

    "line per category, so trimming it saves almost no space and loses "
