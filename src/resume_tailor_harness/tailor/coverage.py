"""Must-have coverage: the deterministic answer the pipeline already computes.

``build_skill_match_context`` maps each job requirement to covered, adjacent,
or gap, together with the matching matrix row and its evidence fact ids. This
module renders that context for prompt consumers and measures which evidenced
must-haves reached the generated resume.

Coverage is advisory rather than a gate. A one-page resume may have to leave a
truthful, evidenced requirement out, and turning that length trade-off into a
blocking failure would make the tailoring loop unwinnable.
