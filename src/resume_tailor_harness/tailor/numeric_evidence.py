"""Deterministic gate: a number in generated prose must come from a cited fact.

The largest class of fact-check failures is an invented quantity -- "saving
hours of manual reporting effort", "3+ years", "reduced planning effort by 40%".
A number is mechanically checkable, so a premium reviewer should not be spending
a round to notice it.

Tokenization is conservative in the permissive direction. A token counts as a
claim only when it stands alone, so `p95`, `L1-L3`, `GPT-4`, `S3`, and `C++` are
never treated as quantities; and a fact's evidence set is every digit run
anywhere in its own fields, so a number the fact states in passing still
legalizes the claim. False blocks cost a round, which is worse than a miss the
LLM fact-checker can still catch.
