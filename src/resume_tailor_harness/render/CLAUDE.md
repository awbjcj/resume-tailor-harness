# Rendering developer reference

Migrated from the project root `CLAUDE.md` (2026-08-15, CLAUDE.md split) — loads only when working under `src/resume_tailor_harness/render/`.

- **Rendering is template-id based.** The web contract is `{template,
fitOnePage}`; legacy `template_path` and `output_dir` remain runtime-only CLI
  fields. Bundled templates are anchored in `render/templates.py`; validated
  custom `.typ` uploads live under the tenant `config/templates/` directory.
  Custom stems are path-safe, Typst compilation is root-pinned, and uploads
  replace live templates only after a successful validation compile. Deleting
  an active custom template falls back to `classic`; missing templates never
  silently fall back during rendering.

- **Eight bundled layouts share `templates/resume-base.typ`.** Stable ids are
  classic, modern, technical, executive, graduate, academic, minimal, compact.
  Source references and the bundled Source Sans 3 license are in
  `templates/README.md` and `templates/fonts/LICENSE.md`. Compile with the
  bundled font directory; do not require host fonts or remote Typst packages.
- **Export length is validated before publication.** `fit_one_page` selects
  one page or a maximum of two. The fitter uses at most five layout probes and
  one optional two-page balance probe; body text stays >=10pt. `PageFitError`
  leaves previous artifacts intact and maps to an actionable 422. Rendering
  never cuts approved content. `services/resume_shape.py` aligns authoring
  budgets with this length before any native planning or external context.
