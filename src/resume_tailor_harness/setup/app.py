"""Thin Textual shell for the setup wizard.

The pure cores (state, yaml_gen, env_writer, preflight, validate, writer) hold
all logic. This App binds screens to a single WizardState and delegates writing
to an injected callable so the wiring is testable without a terminal.

Screen order (spec §5.2): Welcome/preflight, Secrets, Profile sources, Search,
Connectors, Confirm+write, Build profile, Handoff.
