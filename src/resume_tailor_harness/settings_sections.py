"""The single enumeration of user-customizable settings.

Every surface that needs to answer "what can a user customize" reads this
table: the settings bundle (export and import), the reset-to-default controls,
and workspace provisioning. Adding a setting is one row here and it appears in
all three for free.

This table is an ALLOWLIST, and that is load-bearing. It spans the workspace
root, whose other occupants include secrets.env, gmail_token.json,
resume_tailor_harness.db, and config/gmail_credentials.json (an OAuth client secret). A
file not named here can never leave a workspace inside a bundle, nor enter one
from an imported bundle.

Paths are written in the canonical relative form tenancy/paths.py already
speaks -- "config/connectors.yaml", "data/profile/overrides.yaml". One string
serves as the live-file key (via resolve_tenant_path), the archive arcname, and
the lookup for a shipped default.
