"""Redo any pipeline stage on explicitly chosen jobs.

The automatic paths (pull/discover/refresh/reprocess) guard against clobbering
user work: merge.decide() freezes jd_text past raw, and reprocess() skips jobs
with progress. Those guards are right for a scheduled run and wrong for a user
who deliberately picked a job. Redo is the explicit escape hatch, and it never
regresses status, never rejects, and never deletes prior artifacts.
