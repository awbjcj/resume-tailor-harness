"""The one seam that resolves key selection and budget policy for a phase.

Before this module, the same five facts — the user row, shared-key eligibility,
the active rate, the remaining allowance, the platform cap — were derived
independently in three places on **every** LLM call:

* ``resolve_api_key`` → ``shared_key_available`` (asking "which key?")
* ``enforce_agent_budget`` (asking "may I spend?")
* ``record_call`` → ``charge_shared_cost`` (settling)

That is a shallow interface over an expensive implementation: the caller says
"give me a key" and pays for a full policy evaluation, then says "may I spend"
and pays for it again. Measured, it cost 22.2 SQLite statements and one
exclusive ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` per call, all of it synchronous and all of it on
the event loop that the concurrent fan-out shares.

The gate owns credential, endpoint and budget decisions together. Shadow-mode
phases retain the legacy bounded cache; cost enforcement rechecks authoritative
eligibility for each call so another request's spend or entitlement change is
immediately visible. Administrators remain exempt from member allowances, but
all platform funding (including subscription gateway keys) obeys the platform
cap. BYOK remains separate from deployment-owned subscription credentials.
