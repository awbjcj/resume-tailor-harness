"""Where each provider's LLM traffic goes: the subscription gateway, or its API.

A sub2api deployment fronts every provider at one origin, speaking each one's
**native wire format** at its own path -- ``/v1/messages`` for Anthropic,
``/v1/responses`` for OpenAI-compatible traffic, ``/v1beta/models/*`` for
Gemini. It also accepts the API key from whichever header that provider's SDK
already sends (``Authorization: Bearer``, ``x-api-key``, or
``x-goog-api-key``), so routing a call needs no custom headers and no request
rewriting -- only a different ``base_url`` and a different key.

That is the whole feature: one origin, one key per provider, and a per-provider
mode. This module owns the config vocabulary; ``tenancy.spend.SpendGate`` owns
the decision (so "which key?" keeps a single answer, per ADR-0009), and
``llm_runner.build_model`` owns the per-SDK plumbing.

**The fallback is configuration, not a branch.** A provider with no gateway key
-- DeepSeek and Gemini today -- resolves to its direct API key under the
default ``auto`` mode. Nothing in the call path special-cases a provider name.
