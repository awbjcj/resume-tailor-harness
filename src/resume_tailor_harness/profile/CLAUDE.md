# Profile developer reference

Migrated from the project root `CLAUDE.md` (2026-08-15, CLAUDE.md split) — loads only when working under `src/resume_tailor_harness/profile/`.

- **Profile coaching is turn-per-run and evidence-locked.** Durable sessions follow
  ADR 0006, while the ADR 0005 amendment requires every draft note to retain
  verbatim quotes from the current user turn. The former batch interview API,
  CLI command, and web panel are retired; its history remains read-only input
  for avoiding repeated questions.
- **GitHub depth is two-tier; dossiers win.** `profile/github_harvest.py` writes
  qualifying repositories' root docs (README files plus CLAUDE, CONTEXT, and
  AGENTS markdown, capped at 30 KB per file) as deterministic
  `sources/github--<repo>.md` documents with `origin="github"` and
  `mode="project"` during build phase 0 and `profile sync-github`. A markdown
  upload with `repo_url:` frontmatter, such as output from
  `.claude/skills/project-dossier`, supersedes the auto-document for the same
  normalized repository URL. Harvest also discovers root files named
  `*dossier*.md` (max 5 per repo, 30 KB each) whose `repo_url` frontmatter
  matches the repo; each becomes its own `github--<repo>--<stem>.md` project
  source and replaces that repo's README virtual doc. Manual uploads still
  supersede all harvested docs for the repo. `project_extractor.py` can emit exactly one Project
  plus skills, never Experience or Education. GitHub failures become build
  warnings; rate-limited harvests stop early without deleting existing sources.
- **GitHub branch choices are per repository.** `github_repo_branches` maps
  case-insensitive `owner/repo` keys (or legacy short names) to case-sensitive
  branch names; omitted entries follow the repository default. Contents listing
  and every dossier/README request use the same `ref`. Explicit-ref failures keep
  the previous saved files and branch metadata. API sync, ordinary builds, coach
  rebuilds and CLI operations all pass the same saved mapping. Synced sources
  retain `github_branch` for display; uploaded overrides remain authoritative.
- **Source CRUD preserves user intent.** File replacement keeps a source's id,
  primary/mode/anchor and repository identity, invalidates changed fragments,
  and converts a replaced GitHub document into an uploaded override. Explicit
  removals persist exclusions in `sources.json`; removing a repository's last
  source also excludes its shallow metadata project. Automatic harvest cleanup
  does not create exclusions. Restore clears them for the next sync. An empty
  existing manifest is intentional and must not trigger legacy resume migration.
  Dossiers and synthesis documents may stay registered without a primary resume;
  adding the next literal resume promotes it automatically. Profile builds require
  a primary resume, while source management and GitHub sync do not.
  Source mutations and harvest commits share the per-tenant corpus lock;
  extraction publishes hash changes onto the latest manifest instead of saving
  a stale snapshot. `fragment_status=missing` means extraction has not run;
  the API's separate `file_exists` field indicates whether source bytes exist.
- **Profile rebuilds regenerate inferred skills.** `profile build` strips and re-derives
  all `inferred=true` skills; durable corrections belong in `data/profile/overrides.yaml`,
  not hand-edits to facts.json.
- **Synthesis ingest is text-only.** markitdown converts slide text frames, tables, and
  speaker notes; images/diagrams are skipped, and an LLM image description is never
  verification evidence (it would punch a hole in fact-lock). Put key numbers in slide
  text or speaker notes so they are extractable.
- **Profile build fans out per document.** `extract_fragments` /
  `extract_synthesis_fragments` share one cache walk; production runs concurrently via
  `gather_isolated` with the permit acquired only in `llm_runner.acall`. The CLI and API both
  build through `services/profile_build.run_corpus_build` -- the single place the facts+matrix
  bound-artifact pair is written.
- **Project highlights are addressable facts.** `Project.highlights` holds
  `Bullet` objects, not strings, so `index_facts` registers a per-highlight id
  and the provenance gate can reject a fabricated project bullet. Its
  `mode="before"` migration accepts stored legacy string lists with deterministic
  non-empty ids; merge retains the full Bullet rather than flattening it to text.
- **Bullet aspects are durable classifications.** New extractors emit the closed
  aspect vocabulary, while profile build backfills only bullets with
  `aspect is None`. A hand-corrected aspect therefore survives rebuilds; an
  unclassified legacy bullet remains valid and merely has no diversity signal.
- **Anchored coach notes ride verified synthesis.** A seeded `CoachTopic.owner_id`
  becomes a synthesis-mode corpus anchor when its draft is approved, so the
  generated stub merges by the exact experience id rather than heuristic title
  matching. Model-added topics remain unanchored literal notes. The opening
  agenda is seeded from non-empty below-target evidence owners, and user uploads
  that yielded no bullet are question material, never claimable fact.
