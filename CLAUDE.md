# Résumé Tailor Harness — Developer Reference

## Branching

`dev` is the integration branch: all feature work branches from `dev` and
returns to `dev` by PR. `main` only ever receives merges from `dev` — never
directly from a feature branch — and is the only branch Railway deploys
from. The one exception is `hotfix/*`: a branch named `hotfix/*` may PR
directly into `main` for an urgent out-of-band fix; merge it back into `dev`
right after so `dev` doesn't drift from what's deployed. `main` is protected
(PR required, no direct pushes/force-pushes, required status checks:
`ci / python-quality`, `ci / web-quality`, `ci / security-audit`,
`require-dev-base`); the last of those
(`.github/workflows/require-dev-base.yml`) fails any PR into `main` whose
head branch isn't `dev` or `hotfix/*`, since GitHub branch protection has no
native "only allow merges from branch X (or pattern Y)" rule. Dependabot
(`.github/dependabot.yml`) targets `dev` for the same reason — dependency
bumps land on `dev` and ride the normal `dev` → `main` promotion PR like
everything else.

The repo only allows rebase merging (merge commits and squash merges are
disabled at the GitHub repo level): every PR's commits land on the base
branch as-is, with their original messages, instead of a synthetic merge or
squash commit. Because GitHub's rebase-and-merge replays each commit onto
the base's current tip, the replayed commits get fresh SHAs even though
their content is unchanged — so after a `dev` → `main` promotion, `dev` and
`main` hold identical content under _different_ commit hashes and would
drift a little further apart on every single promotion if left alone.
`.github/workflows/sync-dev-with-main.yml` runs on every push to `main` and
force-updates `dev`'s ref to `main`'s new tip whenever their trees already
match (verified via `git diff`, so it never fires when it would lose
commits) — keeping the two branches genuinely in sync, not just
content-equivalent. It intentionally does nothing when the trees differ
(e.g. right after a `hotfix/*` merge, or if new work landed on `dev` while
the promotion PR was merging); the documented manual "merge hotfix back into
dev" step (above) still applies for that path, after which the next push to
`main` fast-forwards `dev` normally.

CI is split by branch so `dev` gets fast feedback and `main` gets the full
gate before a deploy-triggering merge: `.github/workflows/_reusable-ci.yml`
holds the actual jobs (`python-quality`, `web-quality`, `security-audit`)
behind a `full` input; `.github/workflows/ci-dev.yml` calls it with
`full: false` (lint + test only) on pushes/PRs to `dev`, and
`.github/workflows/ci-main.yml` calls it with `full: true` (adds the web
production build and the pip-audit/npm-audit dependency scan) on
pushes/PRs to `main`. `.github/workflows/codeql.yml.disabled` is a
fully-commented placeholder — a fully-commented file with a live `.yml`
extension still gets parsed (and fails) as an invalid workflow by GitHub
Actions, so it's kept as `.disabled` until the repo goes public: rename it
back to `.yml` and uncomment it then.

## Commands

```bash
# Test (offline — no API key, no network needed)
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest

# Lint
ruff check
```

All agent calls and the Playwright browser are faked in tests. Connector backends
are tested against fixture JSON payloads, not live endpoints.

## Architecture map

This file stays intentionally short. Every subsystem's detailed design notes —
the "why", the gotchas, the measured numbers — live in a nested `CLAUDE.md`
that Claude auto-discovers once you're working inside that directory. Read
the linked file before touching that area; don't duplicate its content back
into this one.

## Core invariants (never break these)

These are the rules that must never be violated, anywhere in the codebase.
Full rationale and enforcement detail lives in the linked file — read it
before changing code near the invariant.

- **Tenancy context (ADR-0003).** Multi-user state rides one
  `contextvars.ContextVar` holding the active `UserContext`; `get_settings()`
  must never be cached across requests. → `tenancy/CLAUDE.md`
- **Public network trust boundary (ADR-0008).** Every user-influenced fetch,
  download, render, or archive import goes through `security/outbound.py`'s
  single egress gateway; download routes stay tenant-confined via
  `tenancy/storage.py::artifact_path`; archive extraction is
  resource-bounded, not just path-validated. → `security/CLAUDE.md`
- **Registration modes and spend governance (ADR-0009).** Shared-key spend is
  resolved once per phase by `tenancy/spend.py`'s `SpendGate`; admins are
  exempt from the per-user allowance but remain bound by the platform-wide
  monthly cap. → `tenancy/CLAUDE.md`
- **Fact-lock.** Every bullet on a tailored resume must trace back to a fact
  in `data/profile/facts.json`. Three deterministic gates decide this
  in-process before any reviewer opinion is weighed — `provenance`,
  `skill-naming`, `numeric-evidence` — and the `fact-check` reviewer is a
  hard, unscored gate on top. Their names are reserved: a `ReviewConfig`
  naming one raises. `aggregate` is the only verdict constructor, and any
  failed gate blocks the round regardless of score. Inferred skills are
  evidence pointers — they may guide emphasis but never justify a claim.
  → `tailor/CLAUDE.md`
- **Skill concentration.** A skilled task agent is one Agent family plus
  exactly one `SkillRef` resolved by `career_skills/registry.py` — models
  never choose a path, only a closed capability name. Skill bytes are
  SHA-256-verified against `skills-lock.json` inside the configured root; a
  mismatched, symlinked, or escaping entry raises `SkillUnavailable` and
  disables that capability rather than loading substituted text. The resolved
  ref is persisted with every artifact or turn it influenced.
- **Read-only tool loops.** Every tool exposed inside an agent loop is
  read-only. Writes happen after the loop, through deterministic services,
  behind user approval; anything a tool "verified" is re-verified outside the
  loop before being presented as validated. → `CONTEXT.md`
- **Source priority — upgrade, not drop.** When two sources see the same
  job, the canonical source mutates the existing `Job` row in place over an
  aggregator; user progress is never touched. → `discovery/CLAUDE.md`
- **Archive, delete, prune.** `has_progress()` (status in
  {approved, tailored, rendered} OR any ResumeVersion/CoverLetter OR an
  Application carrying _real investment_ — ADR-0013) is the single gate for
  irreversible paths; `delete_job` refuses jobs with progress. A bare `ready`
  Application does not count: opening the Tracking tab writes one
  unconditionally. → `tracking/CLAUDE.md`
- **Redo — forward-only, never destructive.** `services/redo.py` re-runs any
  stage explicitly; status never regresses, never rejects, never deletes —
  new attempts are appended under an incremented `attempt`. →
  `tracking/CLAUDE.md`
