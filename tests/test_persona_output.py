"""persona_output: streaming prose/metadata split and its degradation rules.

The persona stack asks a model to write prose, then a ``---METADATA---``
sentinel, then formatter input. Compliance is a model behaviour, not an
invariant we control: DeepSeek v4 ignores the sentinel outright (verified
against the live coach prompt on both thinking and non-thinking modes) while
Claude honours it. These tests pin what happens on each side of that.
